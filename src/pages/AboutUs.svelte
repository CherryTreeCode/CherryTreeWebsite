  <h1 class="title">What is Cherry Tree?</h1>
  <p>
    Cherry Tree aims to make charitable donations more accessible and welcoming
    to more people than ever. It aims to do this by creating an online platform
    on which users can, through a single profile and portal, give to their
    desired causes in any amount, no matter how large or small. Their donation
    will automatically be allocated to specific organizations based on their
    preferences, they will be charged no fees, and most importantly they will
    receive feedback that actively shows them the change their donations are
    making to their desired causes.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Cherry Tree will be financed through investors, interest on cash, and
    advertisements, and other sales and strategic partnerships that not only
    generate revenue, but also aid in marketing efforts. Since all initial
    employees are working either on a volunteer basis or for an equity share,
    costs will be low, and almost directly proportional to the number of
    donations the platform receives. With only a small amount of startup
    capital, Cherry Tree will be able to begin bringing users onto the platform
    and encouraging donations that invite the change we want to see.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    This platform differentiates itself from its competitors by combining the
    accessibility of an online aggregation platform with the personalization and
    security of an in-person connection. It will make donors of all means feel
    more comfortable with donating and encourage them to take action where they
    may otherwise not have. Its initiatives and marketing efforts will be
    focused more on the millennial and younger demographics, as they are more
    comfortable with online platforms, and traditionally also give in smaller
    amounts, which is a common deterrent for many donors.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Cherry Tree will be founded as a Public Benefit Corporation in the state of
    Delaware. As its goal is to serve the public good and reinvest back into the
    company or donate it further, it will qualify, as well as providing the
    additional social notoriety associated with a company with a commitment to
    social betterment.
